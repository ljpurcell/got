# GOT
Like Git, but in Go.

Got is a command-line application developed in Go, functioning as a basic version control system similar to Git. It allows users to perform essential operations like initializing repositories, staging changes, committing snapshots, and checking out versions, leveraging Goâ€™s robust file handling and command-line utilities.

## Purpose

1. Develop a deeper understanding of how Git works
2. Build proficiency with Go, particularly working with files

 ## Version control operations

   - **Repository Initialization (`init` command):** Sets up a new repository by creating necessary directory structures and initializing a HEAD file, which tracks the current branch.

   - **Staging Changes (`add` and `remove` commands):** Manages the staging area, where changes are prepped for commits. Involves updating the index with file statuses.

   - **Committing Changes (`commit` command):** Takes a snapshot of the staged changes, creating a commit object that includes metadata like the commit message and parent commit. When committed, files are compressed (using zlib) and this snapshot can be identified by the resulting SHA-1 hash.
     
   - **Checkout Feature (`checkout` command):** Allows users to revert their working directory to the state of a specific commit, identified by its hash.
